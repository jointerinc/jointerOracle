# jointerOracle

Open source oracle created for the Binance Smart Chain community by Jointer.

We created this out of our own need for retrieving wallet token balances for our ERC20 <> BEP20 swap, something that existed on the Ethereum blockchain but not on BSC

We invite you to improve upon this oracle for the good of everyone on Binance Smart Chain
