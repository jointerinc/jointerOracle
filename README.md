# jointerOracle

Open source oracle created for the Binance Smart Chain community by Jointer.

We created this out of our own need for retrieving token balances, something that existed on the Ethereum blockchain but not on BSC

We invite you to improve upon this oracle for the good of everyone on Binance Smart Chain
